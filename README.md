First exercise was pretty easy, it was basic knowledge as long as we listened in class.
Second exercise was also the same
Third exercise was simple but doing the advanced requirement made me kind of confused so I watched a couple tiktok videos. Asked chatgpt to explain the videos I watched and what I can do to make the age part work.
Fourth exercise was surprisingly easy because of the videos I watched prior.
Fifth exercise was a little hard but I got stuck at the advanced part for a little while, I gave up and looked for references in the web.
Sixth exercise I had a little problem. I didn't know how to make it flawless I got errors I looked it up on youtube and I saw how and which codes I should use to make it work, advanced requirement got easy with the information I got.
Seventh exercise it was easy since it was explained in detail in our last class. 
Eighth exercise was also pretty easy things were flowing smoothly at this point.
Ninth and Tenth Exercise was as expected although I didn't really understand it at first I just looked at past videos where in it was tackled. 
The repository was uploaded in bulk since I didn't know how to upload on github although I admit I probably should've done that first.
